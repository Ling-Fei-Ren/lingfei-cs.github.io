**Yuan Sun (孙元)** is a Ph.D. candidate at the College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, advised by Prof. Dezhong Peng (彭德中). His current interests mainly focus on:
- **Image Set Classification**: it constructs an image set consisting of multiple images, and then measures the distance between two sets.
- **Learning to Hash**: it transforms data from original space to Hamming space for fast searching.
- **Multi-view Clustering**: it integrates the supplementary and consistent information of multiple feature extractors for clustering tasks.
